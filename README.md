----    Weather     ----

The dataset reports the temperature recorded in major cities around the world since 1750.
Using this data, the project will need to provide an effective graphical visualization of the
change in temperatures over time, highlighting the cities where the largest temperature
ranges were recorded during different historical periods. For visualization of the data on a
map, see geopandas.
The program will also suggest, depending on the period considered, the best route to follow
for a traveler who intends to move from Beijing to Los Angeles by moving step by step to the
warmest city among the 3 closest to him.

----    Project Requirements    ----
Each project should present the following characteristics:
1. usage of GitHub
2. correct modularisation
3. import and output of data
4. usage of a data manipulation library (e.g. pandas)
5. usage of a scientific computing library (e.g. numPy)
6. usage of a data visualization library (e.g. matplotlib)
7. BONUS - usage of a web app creation framework (e.g. streamlit)

if you want try the project download that dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data
- call the folder dataset
- add it in the same level of the pages and modules 
- after that write in the terminal streamlit run main.py
